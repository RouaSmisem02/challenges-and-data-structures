## Min Stack Challenge

### Problem Domain
Implement a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

### Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs: Series of stack operations.
- Outputs: Results of stack operations, focusing on the minimum value.

### Edge Cases
- Operations on an empty stack.
- Multiple elements with the same minimum value.

### Algorithm
- Utilize two stacks: one for regular elements and another for minimum values.
- Ensure operations like Push, Pop, and GetMin maintain constant time complexity.

### Real Code
Here's the C# implementation of the MinStack class:

```csharp
// Insert your MinStack.cs code here

### Big O Time/Space Complexity
```
Push: O(1)
Pop: O(1)
Top: O(1)
GetMin: O(1)
```
